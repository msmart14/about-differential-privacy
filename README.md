# Learn More About Differential Privacy
Differential privacy provides a way for people to learn from aggregate data while protecting individuals’ privacy. The links below are resources for anyone interested in learning more about differential privacy.

## The Basics
- Differentially-private mechanisms add random noise to data in order to protect privacy. This resource helps explain how randomization can help with privacy:  
[How randomized response can help collect sensitive information responsibly](https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/anonymization/)  

- This short video explains differential privacy in the context of the US Census:  
[Protecting Privacy with MATH](https://youtu.be/pT19VwBAqKA)

## For Engineers
- NIST’s differential privacy blog series is written specifically for business process owners, privacy program personnel, privacy engineers, and IT professionals:  
[Differential Privacy Blog Series](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/collaboration-space/focus-areas/de-id/dp-blog)  

- This blog post compiles information about previous deployments of differential privacy, including links to open-source projects:

## For Social Scientists
- This resource offers a detailed primer on differential privacy:  
[Differential Privacy: A Primer for a Non-Technical Audience](https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&context=jetlaw)  

- These reflections on the US Census Bureau’s implementation of differential privacy will be useful for researchers who are considering using differential privacy:  
[Implementing Differential Privacy: Seven Lessons From the 2020 United States Census](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.353c6f99)  

- In this case study, researchers reflect on their experience as data stewards and discuss why they chose not to use differential privacy:
